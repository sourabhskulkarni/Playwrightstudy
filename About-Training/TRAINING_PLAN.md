## ❓ Common Questions

### Q: Should I read all guides before coding?
**A:** No! Read Day 1 guide → Do Day 1 exercises → Read Day 2 guide → Do Day 2 exercises
Learning by doing works better.

### Q: Can I skip BEGINNER_GUIDE.md?
**A:** If you already know Playwright and TypeScript, maybe. But it's comprehensive,
recommend reading anyway.

### Q: What if a test fails?
**A:** 
1. Read the error message
2. Check if selector is correct (use DevTools)
3. Check if element is visible
4. Add explicit waits
5. Check documentation

### Q: How long does each day take?
**A:**
- Day 1: 4-6 hours (with breaks)
- Day 2: 6-8 hours
- Day 3: 5-7 hours
- Day 4: 7-9 hours
- Day 5: Interview practice

Total: ~30-40 hours for complete training

### Q: Can team learn simultaneously?
**A:** Yes! Trainer presents concepts, team follows along
in VS Code, everyone does exercises.

### Q: Who should read what?
**A:**
- Everyone: BEGINNER_GUIDE.md + DAY1
- Functional testers: All days + hands-on
- 9-year developer: Days 2-4 quickly, focus on Day 5

### Q: What about production testing?
**A:** This course teaches fundamentals. For production:
- Adapt selectors to your site
- Use real test data (not examples)
- Set up CI/CD
- Add reporting
- Scale framework
